# Stand Indivisible

[**Donate now to help fuel Indivisible Colusa County's local activism. Click here to donate easily and securely.**](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/indivisiblecol413728470#)

Indivisible Colusa is completely volunteer run. This summer and fall, we're putting our energy into getting Democrats and progressives to vote in November - here in rural, conservative Colusa County and in neighboring districts where there's a real shot at flipping Congressional seats from red to blue.

We're asking for your help because so much is at stake. If we don't manage to take back Congress in November, we're sure to see an escalation of Trump's war on immigrants, civil rights, women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights, working people and the environment.

Your donation will support the direct costs of our activism in Colusa County and in neighboring Congressional districts. Our costs include door-to-door canvassing supplies including flyers, pledge-to-vote cards, and buttons as well as postcards, postage and other supplies to send Get Out the Vote postcards to Democratic voters.

We have a real opportunity this November to take back the reins of our government and stop Trump's and the GOP's hateful agenda.
