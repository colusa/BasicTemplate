# Stand with Indivisible Colusa 

[**Donate now and your contribution will be matched dollar-for-dollar!** ](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/indivisiblecol413728470#)

As we head into the midterms, the national Indivisible project wants to make sure all the local Indivisible groups have the necessary resources to continue building the blue wave. 

[**Right now, every dollar Indivisible Colusa receives through our ActBlue donation account will be matched one-for-one, up to $500!**](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/indivisiblecol413728470#)

Indivisible Colusa is completely volunteer run. This summer and fall, we're putting our energy into getting Democrats and progressives to vote in November - here in rural, conservative Colusa County and in neighboring districts where there's a real shot at flipping Congressional seats from red to blue.

[**Donate now to help fuel Indivisible Colusa County's work from now until Election Day!**](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/indivisiblecol413728470#)

We're asking for your help because so much is at stake. If we don't manage to take back Congress in November, we're sure to see an escalation of Trump's war on immigrants, civil rights, women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights, working people and the environment.

Your donation will support the direct costs of our activism in Colusa County and in neighboring Congressional districts. Our costs include door-to-door canvassing supplies including flyers, pledge-to-vote cards, and buttons as well as postcards, postage and other supplies to send Get Out the Vote postcards to Democratic voters.

We have a real opportunity this November to take back the reins of our government and stop Trump's and the GOP's hateful agenda.
