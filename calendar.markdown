description: "We are a grassroots group of Colusa County, CA neighbors who embrace
  the American principles of compassion, decency, diversity, tolerance, equality and
  participation in our country's democratic processes. We are committed to countering
  policies and rhetoric that oppose these values. \n\nOur actions are mostly focused
  on holding our elected representatives accountable for listening to us and representing
  us locally, in Sacramento and in Washington, D.C. We use the grassroots advocacy
  tactics described in the Indivisible Guide (www.indivisible.org).\n\nEveryone who
  lives in or near Colusa County and agrees with this approach is welcome to join
  our group. Weâ€™re an all-volunteer group and we have no dues or membership obligations.
  To connect with us, come to a meeting, message us via Facebook or email us at indivisiblecolusa@gmail.com."

**Indivisible Colusa main meetings are the first Monday night of every month in Williams.** If the first Monday is a holiday, we meet the second Monday. We typically spend the first half of the meeting in an informal conversation with a local leader, and the second half discussing what's been happening recently and what's coming up for the local and national Indivisible movement. Our meeting place is on the second floor with no elevator; we are searching for an accessible, centrally located meeting place. 

**We also have informal get-togethers over coffee every Thursday morning in Arbuckle and on the third Saturday morning of the month in Colusa.** This is a great way to get to know locals who are committed to social justice and equality.
