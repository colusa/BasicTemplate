Indivisible Colusa's monthly meetings are the first Monday night in Williams. If the first Monday is a holiday, we meet the second Monday. Our meeting place is on the second floor with no elevator; we are searching for an accessible, centrally located meeting place. 

We also have informal get-togethers over coffee on the third Saturday morning of the month in Colusa. This is a great way to get to know locals who are committed to social justice and equality.
