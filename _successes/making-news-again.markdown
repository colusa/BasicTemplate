Local Indivisible groups were mentioned in the Williams Pioneer Review's article about  Congressman Garamendi's April 19 Town Hall: "Although the northern part of his district, which includes Colusa and Glenn counties, is largely conservative, Garamendi, a Democrat from Walnut Grove, received a warm welcome in Williams.

Attendees at the meeting were mostly members of the Sutter, Yolo, and Colusa Indivisible groups, whose primary focus is to resist Trump Administration policies they believe undermine democracy and constitutional rights.

“There are about 6,000 Indivisible groups across the country,” said Jennifer Roberts, of Arbuckle, co-founder of Indivisible Colusa, who organized Garamendi’s visit."
