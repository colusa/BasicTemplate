Two dozen Indivisible Colusa members traveled to Sacramento for the Women’s March on Saturday, Jan. 20, to take a stand for equality and urge people to make their voices heard by voting in this year’s midterm elections.

Sacramento’s second annual Women’s March drew a record-breaking crowd of roughly 36,000, a sizable increase over last year’s estimated attendance of 20,000. More than two million people participated in the Women’s March over the weekend in hundreds of cities across the nation.
