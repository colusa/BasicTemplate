We did it! We stopped Congress from enacting a highly unpopular bill to "repeal & replace" the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare).

CA District 3 residents -- your calls, letters and emails made a difference. 

And thank you, Rep. Garamendi, for listening to us and vigorously defending the Affordable Care Act.
