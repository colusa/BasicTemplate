We did it! We stopped Congress from gutting the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare). Under Trump and Ryan's highly unpopular bill, 24 million people would have lost health insurance.   

CA District 3 residents -- your calls, letters and emails made a difference. 

And thank you, Rep. Garamendi, for listening to us and vigorously defending the Affordable Care Act.
