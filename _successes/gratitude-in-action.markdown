JULY 2017. We visited Sen. Kamala Harris's Sacramento office to thank her and her staff for fighting the Republican's ACA repeal bill. Our little gratitude action got a Twitter shout out from MSNBC journalist Rachel Maddow. Thanks, Rachel, we love ya! And thank you, Metzer's Farm, for the gorgeous zinnias!
