[Maddow-d63a6c.JPG](/uploads/Maddow-d63a6c.JPG)As part of Indivisible's #KilltheBill National Day of Action on July 18, Indivisible Colusa members visited Senator Kamala Harris's Sacramento office to thank her and her staff for fighting the Republican's ACA repeal bill. 

Our little gratitude action got a Twitter shout out from MSNBC journalist Rachel Maddow. Thanks, Rachel, we love ya!
