At the request of District 3 Indivisible groups (Colusa, Yuba-Sutter, Yolo, Fairfield-Vacaville) and Democracy Winters, Rep. John Garamendi held a town hall in Williams during the April congressional recess.  

For more than an hour and a half, Rep. Garamendi answered constituents' questions about national security, health care, federal budget cuts, immigration and many other pressing concerns.
