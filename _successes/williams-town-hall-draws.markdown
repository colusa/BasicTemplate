At the request of District 3 Indivisible groups and Democracy Winters, Rep. John Garamendi held a town hall on April 19 in the central Colusa County town of Williams. The crowd of more than 100 included members of Indivisible Colusa, Indivisible Yuba-Sutter, Indivisible Yolo, Indivisible Fairfield-Vacaville, Democracy Winters and Yes! Glenn County. 

For more than an hour and a half, Rep. Garamendi answered constituents' questions about national security, health care, federal budget cuts, immigration and many other pressing concerns. He urged the audience to engage with their elected officials at every level of government.
