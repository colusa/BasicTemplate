The first meeting of the Colusa County Democratic Central Committee was held on February 8, 2018. It's been more than two decades since the county has had a Democratic committee. 

County committees drive the front-line efforts of the California Democratic Party: registering and educating voters, protecting the right to vote, and working to elect candidates who will fight for our values. 

The Central Committee is separate from Indivisible Colusa, but many people are involved in both groups. Now is the time to get involved! For more info, email [colusacodcc@gmail.com](mailto:colusacodcc@gmail.com).
