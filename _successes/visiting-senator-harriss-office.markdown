Indivisible Colusa and Indivisible Yolo members stopped in at Senator Kamala Harris's Sacramento office on June 23 to drop off our members' amendments to the Senate's "health care" bill. 

We got a very warm welcome and had a great impromptu meeting with the Senator's staff. We urged the Senator to use every tactic possible to focus attention on this disastrous bill and prevent it from becoming law, including [filibustering by amendment](https://www.ouramendments.org/).
