Indivisible Colusa County enthusiastically endorses Sonia Aery, the Democratic candidate for the California State Assembly’s 3rd District. Indivisible Colusa members are energized by Sonia Aery’s commitment to fighting for economic, social, racial and environmental justice in the North State. 

Born and raised in the district and the daughter of Indian immigrants, Sonia Aery is a Chico-based business owner and affordable housing advocate. Her priorities include Medicare for all, economic policies that are fair to working families, and just and humane immigration laws.
