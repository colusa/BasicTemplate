After Rep. Garamendi's town hall on April 19, the conversations continued at an after-party at Louis Cairo's restaurant in Williams. Members of Indivisible Colusa, Indivisible Yuba-Sutter, Indivisible Yolo, Democracy Winters and staff from Rep. Garamendi's Davis and Yuba City mingled. Thanks, Indivisible Yuba-Sutter, for setting this up!
