On April 8, Indivisible Colusa participated in a gathering for leaders of Northern California Indivisible groups. More than 80 people representing thousands of Indivisible members shared strategies and successes, learned about new resources and tech tools developed by and for Indivisible groups, and got a big dose of inspiration and ideas to bring back to their members. 

Many thanks to Indivisible Healdsburg, Indivisible San Francisco and other Indivisible groups who put together this outstanding event.
