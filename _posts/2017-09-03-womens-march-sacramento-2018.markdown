FROM THE WOMEN'S MARCH SACRAMENTO FACEBOOK EVENT POST
(https://www.facebook.com/events/299702777200197)
 
Join us on Jan 20, 2018, as we march from Southside Park to the California State Capitol to build lasting and meaningful change.

In 2017 we marched and made our voices heard. This year we expand our work to engage youth, uplift women leaders, advocate for gender equity and stand together against voter suppression and for fair protection of all human rights.

We will gather at Southside Park between 6th and 8th Streets. From the Park, we will walk west on T Street to 5th Street, then north on 5th to Capitol Mall, then east to the Capitol building where the rally will convene on the West Steps.

Although registration is not required to attend the march, weâ€™re asking for marchers to register so we can have an accurate count to plan for proper accommodations.
