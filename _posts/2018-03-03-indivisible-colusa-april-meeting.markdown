We're delighted that Indivisible Colusa's April 2 meeting will feature a **conversation with Dillan Horton about engaging young people in Colusa County in progressive political activities.** 

Dillan Horton is Executive Director of the Yolo County Democratic Party and a delegate with the California Democratic Party representing Assembly District 4. At El Camino College and UC Davis, Dillan was very active in student government service. During the 2016 campaign cycle, he founded Students for Hillary, was a board member for Yolo United for Hillary, and was hired to organize Clinton campaign efforts on behalf of the Yolo County Democratic Party.

Indivisible Colusa's monthly meetings are always free and open to the public. Typically we spend about half the meeting in an informal conversation with a local community leader, and the other half discussing recent accomplishments, upcoming activities and developments in the Indivisible movement. 

Indivisible Colusa County is a nonpartisan grassroots group of neighbors who embrace the American values of compassion, decency, diversity, tolerance, equality and democracy.
