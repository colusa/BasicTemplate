Hurricane Harvey is a national crisis. Dozens have lost their lives and there are thousands more who have been displaced, whose homes are underwater, whose lives have been shattered by Harvey. Our thoughts are with the people of Houston and the other affected communities in Texas and Louisiana.

In a moment when we as a nation are confronting an identity crisis, it is encouraging to see story after story of individuals standing up for one another, regardless of race, ethnicity, age, political beliefs, or immigration status. We hope this kindness, respect, and goodwill will carry over into those important fights still to come.

Many of you might be wondering what more you can do to help those affected by Hurricane Harvey. [The national Indivisible website has good information about things you can do.](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/responding-hurricane-harvey/)
