We know now from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that TrumpCare would result in 23 million Americans losing their coverage, higher out-of-pocket costs, the elimination of protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and a return to the chaos that preceded the ACA. And, all to give the rich a giant tax break. 

Senate Republicans are working behind closed doors to come up with their own version of this disastrous House bill. 

Call Sen. Harris and ask her to keep pressure on her Republican colleagues to open up their secretive health care negotiations to public debate.
