Call our Members of Congress - Senators Feinstein and Harris and Congressmember Garamendi - and tell them to gear up for a fight and do everything they can to slow down and expose the Trump Tax Scam for the scam it is.

Indivisible and other activist groups have a National Week of Action planned for November 6-12. This timing overlaps with the mark ups in the Ways & Means Committee and will demonstrate a massive national opposition to the Trump Tax Scam. We need everyone on board with this effort!

Republicans are expected to unveil the full text of their tax bill on Thursday, Nov. 2, after months of speculation. Two memos showed early on that “tax reform” is nothing more than giveaways for Donald Trump and his buddies.

Here’s what we know already about the #TrumpTaxScam:

GOP donors, Wall Street, and the Trump family have looked into their crystal ball and see dollar signs and cuts to social programs. If the GOP passes their tax cuts, it’ll balloon the deficit and they’ll demand cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security.

No, really. The GOP wants tax cuts more than anything. That’s why they tolerate a dangerously incompetent President. Republicans still don’t have a major legislative victory because we the people have out-organized them at every step of the way. And the GOP cares about this a lot more than they care about healthcare repeal because tax “reform” puts more money in their pockets. They’ve been waiting for 8 years, and they’re tolerating Trump’s abuse, just for this moment.

We can, and must, stop this bill with constituent power. The tax fight and the healthcare fight are the SAME FIGHT. And, just like with healthcare, we can defeat them with nationwide constituent power. On your our turf. On the phone. In DC. Our voices can shape this fight. If we kill this bill, we’ll not only deny Trump yet another win, but we’ll also demoralize the GOP, dry up their campaign contributions, and likely shift the balance of power in 2018. 

As Republican Senator Lindsay Graham admitted, "[if we fail on taxes, that's the end of the Republican Party's governing majority in 2018](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/27/politics/kfile-lindsey-graham-tax-reform/index.html)."
