Call Senators Feinstein and Harris and Congressman Garamendi and urge them do everything they can to expose the Trump tax plan for the scam it is.

Indivisible has a National Week of Action planned for November 6-12. This timing overlaps with the mark ups in the Ways & Means Committee and will demonstrate a massive national opposition to the Trump Tax Scam. We need everyone on board with this effort!

**What's coming up**
Republicans are expected to unveil the full text of their tax bill on Thursday, Nov. 2, after months of speculation. Two memos showed early on that “tax reform” is nothing more than giveaways for the super rich.

Here’s what we know already about the #TrumpTaxScam:

* GOP donors, Wall Street, and the Trump family have looked into their crystal ball and see dollar signs and cuts to social programs. If the GOP passes their tax cuts, it’ll balloon the deficit and they’ll demand cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security.

* The GOP wants tax cuts more than anything. That’s why they tolerate a dangerously incompetent President. Republicans still don’t have a major legislative victory because we the people have out-organized them at every step of the way. And the GOP cares about this a lot more than they care about healthcare repeal because tax “reform” puts more money in their pockets. They’ve been waiting for 8 years, and they’re tolerating Trump’s abuse, just for this moment.

**We can, and must, stop this bill.** Just like with Trumpcare, we can defeat it with nationwide constituent power. On our home turf. On the phone. In DC. Our voices can shape this fight. If we kill this bill, we’ll not only deny Trump yet another win, but we’ll also demoralize the GOP, dry up their campaign contributions, and likely shift the balance of power in 2018. 

As Republican Senator Lindsay Graham admitted, "[if we fail on taxes, that's the end of the Republican Party's governing majority in 2018](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/27/politics/kfile-lindsey-graham-tax-reform/index.html)."
