**This Week's Call to Action is a Matter of Life or Death **

Let’s be clear, if TrumpCare gets through the Senate, it will probably become law. The highest hurdle for Republicans was always the Senate, which means that if they manage to jam it through, there’ll be nothing left to stop it from getting to Trump’s desk. That’s why our focus needs to remain on our Senators. 

But Senators Feinstein and Harris already oppose TrumpCare, right? Yes, but they have not yet done everything within their power to slow or stop the process in the Senate.

Here's what you can do to hold our senators accountable, in three steps:

**1.** Mark your calendars and spread the word: **National Senate Call-In Day to Stop TrumpCare is Wednesday, June 14.** If you can't make your calls on Wednesday, chose another day this week.

**2. On June 14, call the Washington D.C. offices of Sen. Feinstein and Sen. Harris. **The person answering the phone will be a staff assistant or intern. Ask for the Senator's legislative assistant who handles healthcare (they're listed below). Often, you'll be put through to that person's voicemail. Leave one. And then send a follow-up email.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein
Megan Thompson, Legislative Assistant for healthcare

Sen. Kamala Harris
Grant Barbosa, Legislative Assistant for healthcare
[grant_barbosa@harris.senate.gov](mailto:grant_barbosa@harris.senate.gov)
202-224-355

**What should you say?**
* Thank the Senator for opposing TrumpCare.
* If possible, say a few words about how you or your family would be affected by TrumpCare. Personal stories are incredibly powerful.
* Then say: Opposing TrumpCare is important, but I'm counting on the Senator to do everything in her power to stop the bill from passing. I'm asking the Senator to commit to withholding consent on all Senate business until Republicans agree to hold public hearings on healthcare.  

**3.  Follow up with an email **to Thompson and Barbosa emphasizing what you said on the phone. 

Senate Republicans are acting with speed and secrecy - they may vote on TrumpCare any day now. We need to keep showing that there's an overwhelming, nationwide wave of opposition to this bill. Calling our Members of Congress is the core Indivisible tactic for making our voices heard in Washington.
