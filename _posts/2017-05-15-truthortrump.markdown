UPDATED 5/15/17: Call Senators Feinstein and Harris and urge them to withhold consent on Senate business until the Department of Justice appoints a special prosecutor to investigate connections between Donald Trump and the Russian government. Our Senators have a duty to act when the American public and our national security are put at risk.

CALL SCRIPT

My name is ______. I'm a constituent of Senator \[Feinstein/Harris\] and my zip code is _____. I'm also a member of Indivisible Colusa, in Colusa County.

I'm calling to urge Senator \[Feinstein/Harris\] to withhold consent on any business in the Senate, until the Department of Justice appoints a special prosecutor to investigate connections between Donald Trump and the Russian government.

The Washington Post has reported that Trump revealed classified information during a meeting with Russian officials the day after firing Director James Comey. By doing so, Trump has put American national security, and the American people, at risk.

This only adds greater urgency for the need for a special prosecutor to investigate Russian ties to the Trump administration. We simply cannot go on with business as usual and let this issue go unaddressed or be put on the back burner by the GOP.

The Department of Justice must appoint special prosecutor to get to the bottom of these issues and restore confidence in our democracy.
