UPDATED 5/15/17: Call Senators Feinstein and Harris and urge them to withhold consent on Senate business until a truly independent prosecutor is appointed to investigate connections between Donald Trump and the Russian government. 

Our Senators have a duty to act when the American public and our national security are put at risk. If you keep calling and can’t get a live person, then leave a voicemail. Be sure to give your zip code and mention that you are a member of Indivisible Colusa. Members of Congress are specifically tracking communications from Indivisible groups. Let’s show them that we are a real force in standing up for truth and transparency.

CALL SCRIPT

My name is __________. I'm a constituent of Senator [Feinstein/Harris]. My zip code is  _______ . I'm also a member of Indivisible Colusa, in Colusa County.

I'm calling to urge Senator [Feinstein/Harris] to withhold consent on any business in the Senate, until a truly independent prosecutor is appointed to investigate connections between Trump and his associates and Russia. 

The Washington Post has reported that Donald Trump revealed classified information during a meeting with Russian officials the day after firing Director James Comey. By doing so, Trump has put American national security, and the American people, at risk. 

This only adds greater urgency for the need for a special prosecutor to investigate Russian ties to the Trump administration. We simply cannot go on with business as usual and let this issue go unaddressed or be put on the back burner by the GOP.  

We must have an independent investigation to get to the bottom of these issues and restore confidence in our democracy.
