call-script-text: "Hi, my name is _______ and I’m a constituent from zip code______
  and a member of Indivisible Colusa. \n\nI’m calling to ask [Congressman Garamendi/Senator
  Feinstein/Senator Harris] to do everything in their power to get the Trump Administration
  to rescind their inhumane policy of separating children from their parents at the
  border. Many of these families are refugees desperately fleeing violence in their
  home countries and presenting themselves at our Ports of Entry to ask for asylum.
  \n\nBorder security cannot come at the expense our our humanity.\n\nThank you."

Call your Members of Congress and urge them to do everything in their power to get the Trump Administration to rescind their inhumane family separation policy.
