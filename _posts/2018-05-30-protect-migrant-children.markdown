call-script-text: "Hi, my name is _______ and I’m a constituent from zip code______
  and a member of Indivisible Colusa. \n\nI’m calling to ask [Congressman Garamendi/Senator
  Feinstein/Senator Harris] to do everything in their power to get the Trump Administration
  to rescind their inhumane policy of separating children from their parents at the
  border. Many of these families are refugees desperately fleeing violence in their
  home countries and presenting themselves at our Ports of Entry to ask for asylum.
  \n\nBorder security cannot come at the expense our our humanity.\n\nThank you."

Call your Members of Congress and urge them to do everything in their power to get the Trump Administration to rescind their inhumane family separation policy. 

If you live in Colusa County, your Members of Congress are Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Kamala Harris and Congressman John Garamendi. 

Calling them is faster and more effective than writing a letter or email. If you call during office hours, you can give your comment to the staff person who answers the phone. It's their job to take constituent comments. If you get voice mail during office hours or call after hours or on weekends, just leave your comment on voice mail. And be sure to say what zip code you're calling from. 

All the calls and voice mails from constituents are tallied daily. Your voice will make a difference - but only if you speak up.
