Join Colusa County residents to stand in solidarity with Charlottesville and against racism and hatred. This is a peaceful, nonpartisan gathering to show our unity in rejecting racism, white supremacism and Nazism. 

Hundreds of vigils are taking place across the country today and tonight. We're choosing to gather at Colusa's Veterans Memorial Park to honor the legacy of our veterans who defended the world from Nazism - the same evil scourge we saw on display in Charlottesville this weekend. 

This is an informal gathering to show strength and unity against hatred. We encourage you to bring signs of hope, peace and love.
