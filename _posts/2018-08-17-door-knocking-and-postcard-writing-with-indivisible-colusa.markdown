LOCATION & TIME CHANGE: On Tuesday, 10/30 we are canvassing in Maxwell (NOT Colusa). Please meet at 4:00 PM at the Maxwell Little League Field, 141-151 S. Pacific St., Maxwell. 

Face-to-face conversations are THE most effective way to Get Out the Vote. Join us for our community block walking events in Colusa this fall. We'll be knocking on doors of registered Democrats to boost the local vote for the midterm election.

No canvassing experience necessary. We'll provide training at the start of each session, mapped out addresses, and an Indivisible Colusa tote bag with flyers to give out and our popular Trump Survival Kits to give away. Come with a friend or come on your own and we'll pair you up with one of our awesome volunteers.
