Last week brought cause to celebrate: the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that blocked President Trump's travel ban from six mostly Muslim countries. 

Take a couple of minutes to call Rep. GaramendiÂ this week to thank him for forcefully and repeatedly denouncing this reprehensible ban. 

We want him to know that constituents of even the most conservative parts of District 3 agree with his statement that "Muslim Americans form an integral part of the American fabric, and we cannot sacrifice our values for a misguided policy that will not make us safer."
