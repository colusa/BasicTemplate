The defeat of TrumpCare in the Senate last week was an incredible testament to the work we and other Indivisiblers and resisters have done to keep sustained, organized pressure on our members of Congress. 

Every phone call, every postcard and letter, every meeting and march and rally, every visit to the office of a member of congress and every sign we waved made a difference. Each one of these actions contributed to a groundswell of constituent power that stiffened the spines of Democrats and put fear in the hearts of Republicans. 

This relentless constituent force from every corner of the country - including right here in Colusa County - made this win possible. 

There are more fights to come. Zombie TrumpCare could be dead or could be back in the not-too-distant future. But this was a huge win. Our action for this week: own it and savor it.
