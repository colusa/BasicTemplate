**NEW LOCATION & TIME: Our August 18 coffee meetup will be at LA FORTUNA BAKERY, 669 F St., Williams at 10:00 AM.** Look for folks wearing Indivisible Colusa shirts or buttons! 

THE RESISTANCE WILL BE CAFFEINATED! Come on out for coffee, camaraderie and conversation with Indivisible Colusa members. There’s no set agenda - we can share what’s been going on in the Indivisible movement locally and nationally, brainstorm ideas for future actions, or just enjoy some conversation with other progressive-leaning locals.

Newcomers welcome, and feel free to bring friends and family.
