**SOCIAL MEDIA FOR ACTIVISTS TRAINING**

We're very pleased to announce that Isabel, Indivisible Yolo's social media guru and podcast co-host, will be coming up from Davis for our July 10 meeting to lead a hands-on social media for activists training.

Love it or hate it, there's no doubt that social media is a crucial tool for civic engagement. Don't miss our July 10 meeting for this free, fun and informative session. 

**When:** Monday, July 10, 6:30-8:00 PM. Social media training is 6:30-7:30; Indivisible Colusa update is 7:30-8:00.

**Where:** 528 7th St., Williams (the meeting room is up a flight of stairs)

**What & why:** Learn strategies for using the Big Three - Facebook, Twitter and Instagram - to effectively share our stories, amplify our actions and spark more civic engagement. Check out a new app designed by and for Indivisibles that makes it easy to call our Members of Congress. Find out about secure digital tools for group communications. 

**What to bring:**
Bring your smartphone with Facebook, Twitter and Instagram apps installed. If you have an Android or Google phone, also install the SoundCloud app - that's what we'll use to check out the Indivisible Yolo podcast.

It's best if you set up your social media accounts in advance but if you need help, we’ll show you during the training.

No smartphone? That’s OK. We’ll have a couple of laptops at the meeting so you can log into Facebook and Twitter. 
Indivisible Colusa’s meetings are always free and open to the public.


**Please note:**
Our meeting place is on the second floor and there is no elevator. If that's a problem for you, please email us at [indivisiblecolusa@gmail.com](mailto:indivisiblecolusa@gmail.com) and we will try to find an accessible meeting place.

Indivisible Colusa's meetings are always free and open to the public. Newcomers are very welcome!
