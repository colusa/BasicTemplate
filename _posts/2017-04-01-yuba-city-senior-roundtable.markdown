Congressman Garamendi is hosting a series of senior conversations throughout the 3rd District focused on the concerns of local seniors. On April 19th, Congressman Garamendi will be at the Yuba City Senior Center on 777 Ainsley Avenue from 10:30 am-12:00 pm. 

Case workers will be standing by to help constituents with their Social Security, Medicare, and VA claims. Congressman Garamendi will also be discussing legislation heâ€™s introducing to expand Medicare coverage, create new cost of living standards for Social Security, and safeguard crucial protections that you rely on. 

Everyone is welcome - you don't have to be a senior.
