Senators Feinstein and Harris and Congressman Garamendi have all spoken out in favor of an independent investigation into Russia's ties to the Trump administration. Call to thank them and urge them to turn up the heat on their demands for an independent investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion between Russia and members of the Trump administration and Trump campaign. 

Congress owes the American people the full story of the scope and severity of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, which can only be accomplished through the establishment of an independent special commission.
