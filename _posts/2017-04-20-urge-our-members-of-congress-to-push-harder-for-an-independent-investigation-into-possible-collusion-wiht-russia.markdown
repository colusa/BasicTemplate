Senators Feinstein and Harris and Congressman Garamendi have all spoken in favor of an independent investigation into Russia's ties to the Trump administration. Call to thank them and urge them to turn up the heat on demands for an independent investigation. 

Our three members of Congress need to hear directly from us that we demand an aggressive, independent inquiry and that we're outraged by the compromised House of Representatives' investigation led by Devin Nunes. 

Congress owes the American people the full story of the scope and severity of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, which can only be accomplished through the establishment of an independent special commission.
