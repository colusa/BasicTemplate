Colusa County residents, please join State Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry for complimentary coffee Thursday, August 17 at Granzella's in Williams to discuss state legislation, issues impacting your community or the state of California, and ways her office can assist you. This is a great opportunity to voice your opinions and share your comments with your state elected official. 

Ms. Aguiar-Curry is holding this Community Coffee at Indivisible Colusa's request. Let's give her a good turn out!
