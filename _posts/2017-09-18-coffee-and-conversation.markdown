THE RESISTANCE WILL BE CAFFEINATED!
Come on out for coffee & conversation with Indivisible Colusa members. There's no set agenda - we can share what's been going on in the Indivisible movement locally and nationally, brainstorm ideas for future actions, or just enjoy some conversation with other progressive-leaning people. 

Newcomers welcome, and feel free to bring friends and family.

Look for people wearing "We are Indivisible Colusa" buttons. If you don't see us inside Caffeinated, check in the back (outside). Hope to see you there!
