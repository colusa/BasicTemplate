STAND UP FOR SAFER COMMUNITIES FOR ALL!

California's "sanctuary state" law is under attack by anti-immigrant groups and politicians. Write postcards with us on Tuesday night to tell our local elected officials we support this humane law that helps make our communities safer.

Indivisible Colusa will supply addresses, message suggestions, pens, postcards and stamps. You're also welcome to bring your own.

It's an open-house type gathering - come when you can, stay as long as you like. Buy your own dinner or just have a drink. Please join us!
