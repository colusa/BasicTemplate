Senators Feinstein and Harris are not yet doing everything they can to protect our healthcare. This week, we need to call daily to turn up the heat and get them to act. The national Indivisible team has created some great resources to help us:

1. **Call both Senators daily.** Use this script to demand that they [slow down Senate business by withholding consent on all regular Senate business, and prepare to filibuster by amendment](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/withholding-consent-filibuster-amendment-call-script/) until and unless there are public hearings on TrumpCare.

2. After your calls, **use these social media shareables** to hold [Feinstein](/uploads/protect_healthcare_dems-15.jpg) and [Harris](/uploads/protect_healthcare_dems-18.jpg) accountable and demand they #WithholdConsent. (The two links are to .jpg files; you can open and save them and then share on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.)

**Our work *this week* is what will win the TrumpCare fight.** Senate Republicans are planning to vote on their still-secret bill in the next two weeks. We still don’t have text. Or a CBO score. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is [too busy twisting arms and cutting deals with Senators to meet with patient groups like the March of Dimes and the American Heart Association](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-republicans-obamacare-secrecy-20170616-story.html).

But none of that will matter in the end: if they get the votes, they’ll pass it in the dead of night, without any public input, and without knowing its full impact on the American people. McConnell will schedule this bill for a vote as soon as he secures enough support.

So if you wait until a vote is scheduled to act, you’ve waited too long.

### Contact Details

Try to reach the Senators' staff in charge of healthcare legislation in DC (names below). If that doesn't work, speak to whoever answers the phone in the DC and district offices (it's usually an intern or junior staffer). Or call after hours and leave a message. The most important thing is to call and make your voice heard.
