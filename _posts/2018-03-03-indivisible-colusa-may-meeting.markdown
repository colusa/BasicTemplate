NEW LOCATION: COLUSA MAIN LIBRARY, Morse Conference Room, 738 Market St., Colusa

At our May meeting, we'll hear from leaders of the resistance group, Sister District-CA3, about their efforts to unseat Representative Tom McClintock. And we'll share ideas about how our groups might work together to support progressive policies and candidates in our region. 

We'll also provide a brief voter registration training. There's an election coming up on June 5 - you can make a difference by registering voters, reminding people to vote, and sending postcards to voters. It's easy! Come to our meeting and we'll walk you through it. 

Indivisible Colusaâ€™s monthly meetings are always free and open to the public. Indivisible Colusa County is a nonpartisan grassroots group of neighbors who embrace the American values of compassion, decency, diversity, tolerance, equality and democracy.
