#### Each tshirt, sweatshirt or hoodie you buy directly funds our efforts to boost the local Democratic vote in the November midterm election.

**We've got six styles - classic tees, crew sweatshirts and hoodies - in three great colors.**

Our amazing volunteers are putting in countless hours to boost the Democratic vote in Colusa County and flip neighboring Congressional districts from red to blue. We need your help to pay for +2,000 postcards and stamps for our postcards to voters events, plus flyers and supplies for our door-to-door canvassing. A portion of each purchase directly pays for our local activism 

[**Your order must be placed by September 5th.**](https://www.bonfire.com/indivisiblecolusa/) Your order will ship directly to you and will arrive  between Sept. 14 to Sept. 25. 

Our local progressive activism is fueled by our volunteers' passion and your support. Thank you!
