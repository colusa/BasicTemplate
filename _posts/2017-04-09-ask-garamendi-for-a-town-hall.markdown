**Call Congressman Garamendi's office NOW to urge that he hold an Immigration Town Hall in Colusa or Yuba Counties during the current congressional recess (April 8-23).**

**Why is this an urgent priority?** The Trump administration is waging a concerted attack against immigrants and refugees. We’ve already seen what this looks like: Muslim and Refugee bans, ramped-up internal immigration enforcement, racial profiling, harassment, and privacy violations at the US border. **This is only the beginning.** Trump is gearing up to unleash a wave of raids that will be unprecedented in both number and intensity.

It is no exaggeration to say that ICE agents are now terrorizing our communities, our neighbors, and our families. Immigrants fearful of being detained and separated from their families are being pushed deeper into the shadows. This is not who we are, and this is not what the majority of Americans voted for.

### WE STAND INDIVISIBLE WITH IMMIGRANTS

Trump won’t stop terrorizing immigrants on his own — it is up to all of us to stop him. Fighting back on these attacks remains a top priority for Indivisible groups across the country, and especially for Indivisible groups such as ours that have large immigrant populations. 

We strongly believe that all of Trump’s anti-immigrant policies can be stopped by Congress. To this end, Indivisible Colusa members are urging Congressman Garamendi to hold an Immigration Town Hall in April in Colusa County or Yuba County. 

We have many questions and concerns about how Trump's attack on immigrants is affecting our families, friends, neighbors and coworkers. It is urgent that we hear directly from our Congressman about what he is doing to protect families from being torn apart and to protect democracy from this aspiring tyrant.
