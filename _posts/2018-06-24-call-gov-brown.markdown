call-script-text: "Hi, my name is ___. I live in (town). I'm also a member of Indivisible
  Colusa.\n\nIâ€™m calling to leave a comment for Governor Brown about the humanitarian
  crisis created by the President Trump's \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy. \n\nMany
  of the separated children are being held in private detention facilities in California.
  I'd like to urge the Governor to send officials to visit and inspect these detention
  centers to make sure they are following state licensing standards. \n\nI also urge
  the Governor to use his power and resources to make sure these children are swiftly
  and safely reunited with their families. \n\nEven though this is a crisis manufactured
  by Trump, it's our duty as Californians to make sure these children are not further
  traumatized. \n\nThank you. "

President Trump manufactured this humanitarian crisis, but it's our duty to make sure these children are not further traumatized.
