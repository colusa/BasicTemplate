Come to our open meetings to learn about the Indivisible movement. Our February meeting will feature an informal conversation with Colusa County Supervisor Denise Carter as well as a briefing on the Voter Engagement Training some of our members are participating in.

We're a small, friendly group of Colusa County residents who work together to organize local political actions and events, participate in meetings with and coordinate phone calls to elected representatives, and more. We promote engagement in our country's democratic processes, particularly by encouraging our Members of Congress in the Senate and House to listen to us and represent us.

We meet monthly on the first Monday of the month. Our meetings are always free and open to the public. Please note that our meeting place is on the second floor and there is no elevator. We are working on finding an accessible, centrally located meeting place.
