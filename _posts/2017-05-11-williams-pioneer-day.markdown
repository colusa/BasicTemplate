Coming to Williams Pioneer Day on June 3? Be sure to stop by Indivisible Colusa's booth to say hello and learn about our group. We're residents of Colusa County working together to advocate for inclusiveness, fairness, decency and participation in our country's democratic processes. We're committed to countering policies and rhetoric that oppose these values.

Williams Pioneer Day is an annual parade and festival put on by Citizens for a Better Williams. The event celebrates our farming history, our farmers, ag industries, and farm workers. This year's theme is OUR FARMS FEED FAMILIES!

Williams Pioneer Day
When: Saturday, June 3, 9 AM to 12 PM
