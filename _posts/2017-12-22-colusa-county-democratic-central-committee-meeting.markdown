Colusa County is one of only two counties in California without a Democratic Party Central Committee. But that's about to change! Local dedicated Democrats have worked over the past few months to get a Colusa County Democratic Central      Committee off the ground.  

There's a kickoff meeting on February 8 to approve the committee's bylaws      and elect officers. Everyone      is welcome to come and learn about the committee, and Democrats      registered in Colusa County are eligible to serve as officers.

County committees drive the front-line efforts of the California Democratic Party: registering and educating voters, protecting the right to vote, and working to elect candidates who will fight for our values. Now is the time to get involved!
