On Tuesday, July 18, the whole national INDIVISIBLE network will be showing up at senators offices around the country to say that TrumpCare would hurt our friends, our families, our communities and our country. 

**Here's what's going on locally:**
Join Indivisible Yolo, Indivisible Colusa, Democracy Winters and other Sacramento-area resistance and health care groups in visiting Sen. Kamala Harris' office in Sacramento on Tuesday, 7/18 between 10 AM and 5 PM. 

Show your support for the ACA and your opposition to TrumpCare. Share your story! Bring letters, signs and other examples of how you would be affected by the Republican "health care" bill. This isn't a formal rally. We're asking people to just show up on Tuesday - bring a friend, bring a neighbor, bring a fellow #resistance member or just show up on your own. 

Head up to her office (go through security in the lobby then take the elevator to the 7th floor) and spend a few minutes talking to her staff about why we have to #KilltheBill once and for all. Sen. Harris has been a vocal defender of the ACA so this is a great chance to express our gratitude and urge her to keep fighting. 

No matter what time you can make it, swing by - even just for 5 minutes! Your voice matters! Our goal is to have people stopping in at her office all day long. We are especially looking for folks who can stop by after 1:30 pm. 

**Note that Sen. Harris' Sacramento office is open 8:30-5:00.**
