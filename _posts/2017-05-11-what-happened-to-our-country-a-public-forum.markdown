FEATURING:
Sasha Abramsky, keynote address

What happened to our country and its promise of liberty and justice for all?

To explore this question, please join us for a keynote address with journalist and author, Sasha Abramsky. Abramsky will draw from research for his new book Jumping at Shadows: The Triumph of Fear and the End of the American Dream to discuss our current political situation and how we can fight the consequences of the Presidentâ€™s radical agenda, an agenda that continues to widen inequality in the US. Come learn how you can effectively bring about change that will integrate equity into the social, economic, and political systems that affect people's everyday lives. 

A panel discussion will follow, moderated by Davis City Councilmember Lucas Frerichs, which will tie the larger themes of Abramsky's address to the local context. The panel will include:
Mindy Romero, UC Davis Center fo Regional Change
Sandy Holman, the Culture CO-OP/United in Unity
Kate Laddish, Democracy Winters
Anne Kjemtrup, Davis Muslim Hands 

In the second part of the forum, community members can connect with organizations from all over Yolo County at an "activist fair." These organizations are working on issues such as immigrant and farm workers' rights, NODAPL and climate change, advocacy with members of Congress, and universal health care. Representatives will have information and answer questions. 

This dynamic event will deepen your understanding of the challenges facing our communities and our country, and will give you the tools and the outlets to make change where you live.
