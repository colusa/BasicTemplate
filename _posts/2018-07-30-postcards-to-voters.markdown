**Please join us for a fun evening of writing postcards to registered Democrats in Colusa County. Our postcard parties are popular and productive - and they do a lot more good for our Democracy than yelling at the TV!**

Friendly, handwritten postcards from volunteers is a great way to motivate voters who might normally sit out a midterm election.

Indivisible Colusa provides the postcards, stamps, pens and even the script. No experience necessary. Newcomers welcome!

Find us in the back room of El Mex-Kal Family Mexican Restaurant. We'll provide guac & chips. You buy your own drinks and/or dinner. Come for part of the time or stay the whole time.
