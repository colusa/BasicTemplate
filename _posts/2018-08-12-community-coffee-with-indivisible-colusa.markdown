Come on out for our coffee and conversation with Indivisible Colusa members on the 3rd Saturday of each month. There’s no set agenda - we can share what’s been going on in the Indivisible movement locally and nationally, brainstorm ideas for future actions, or just enjoy some conversation with other progressive-leaning locals.

Newcomers welcome, and feel free to bring friends and family. Drop in for a few minutes or stay the whole time. 

Look for people wearing “Indivisible Colusa” shirts or buttons.
Hope to see you there!
