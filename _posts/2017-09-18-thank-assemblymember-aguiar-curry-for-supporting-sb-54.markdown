Call State Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry (District 4, which includes Arbuckle and Williams) and **thank her for standing for all Californians and supporting the California Values Act (SB 54)**. California lawmakers passed this "sanctuary state" bill on September 16, 2017 to protect undocumented immigrants and to counter expanded deportation actions under the Trump administration.

The legislation limits state and local law enforcement communications with federal immigration authorities. It also prevents state and local officers from questioning or holding people on immigration violations.
