**TrumpCare is back. REPEAT: TrumpCare is back.**

This is the bill that just won’t die. Because of the rules of reconciliation, the special process Republicans are using to jam TrumpCare through the Senate, they only have until September 30 to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That gives them 14 days to make good on their seven-year promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And nothing motivates Congress like a deadline.

Forget about the recent talk of bipartisanship. This “Graham-Cassidy” TrumpCare bill was developed in secret, without open hearings or input from Democrats. The bill has already been sent to the Congressional Budget Office for a score -- step one in moving the bill forward. Leader Mitch McConnell is whipping votes and rearranging the Senate calendar to make room for one final push. He’s hoping we won’t notice.

Let’s be clear. TrumpCare by any other name is still TrumpCare. **Graham-Cassidy destroys Medicaid as we know it, hurts people with pre-existing conditions, and takes away the funding that helps people afford insurance. This bill also cuts federal funding to states for healthcare costs.** It then creates “block grants” to give states much less money than they need and has no accountability that the money will actually help people get affordable health care. And to top off this monstrous bill? Every last dollar disappears after 2026. (If you want the wonky details, [here's a good explainer](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/trumpcare-another-name-graham-cassidy/) from the national Indivisible team.)

**Once again, it’s up to us to kill TrumpCare.** We did this before. We can do it again. Remember, millions of people are depending on us. 

So here's what we need to do: We know Senators Feinstein and Harris oppose TrumpCare. But they aren't doing everything they can to block it. **Call today and tell them they must pull out all the stops to block TrumpCare.** [There's an excellent script here](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/last-push-trumpcare-tell-dems-run-clock/), but the basic message is: we want our Senators to withhold consent on all legislative business until TrumpCare is defeated for good.
