Indivisible Colusa is joining the Tax March Sacramento to demand that President Trump release his tax returns and bring transparency to his business dealings. Plan to join us and stay tuned for info on meet up points, carpools, and a sign-making party.

The Sacramento Tax March is one of more than 100 Tax Marches nationally. Sacramento is getting a huge response and is likely to be one of country's largest marches on April 15. Don't miss it!
