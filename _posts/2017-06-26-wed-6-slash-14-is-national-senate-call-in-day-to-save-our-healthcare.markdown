Indivisible groups across the country spent the 4th of July congressional recess week fighting for our health care — and it’s working:

* New York Times: [G.O.P. Support of Senate Health Repeal Erodes During Break](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/us/politics/republicans-health-care-bill.html)
* Washington Post: [Republicans increasingly uncertain of a legislative victory before August](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/republicans-increasingly-uncertain-of-a-legislative-victory-before-august/2017/07/08/)
* POLITICO: [It was a grim week for the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/07/gop-health-plan-home-districts-misgivings-240306)

The fight’s not over yet, but it’s clear that Senators are starting to listen to their constituents instead of blindly supporting TrumpCare. We don’t expect that the Senate will vote on TrumpCare this week, but the vote could come the week of July 17. **Local constituent pressure now will determine the political outcome later this month.** Here’s how to keep it up: 

1. [**Keep calling Senators Feinstein and Harris**](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/withholding-consent-filibuster-amendment-call-script/). Thank them for fighting TrumpCare and urge them to use all procedural tactics possible to block the GOP Senate's bill, including withholding consent and filibustering by amendment. 

2. **Encourage family and friends in states with Republican senators** to keep lighting up their senators' phones. 

3. Check out the call scripts, explainers and other fantastic resources in [**Indivisible's Stop Trumpcare toolkit**](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/stop-trumpcare/). The national Indivisible team does a great job of explaining complex policy in plain English - and suggesting practical, effective actions we can take. 


### About Calling Member of Congress

All phone numbers for Colusa County's Members of Congress are listed on this page. If you get voicemail, leave a message and include your area code. If you get a busy signal, try the next number on the list rather than putting off the call until later. It's OK to call after business hours and leave a message - your comments will still be noted and tallied.
