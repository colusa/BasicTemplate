No exaggeration: We’ve been at this 5 months, and this is the most important week in our fight against TrumpCare. Republicans are planning a vote THIS THURSDAY. But they still don’t have the votes. This truly could go either way. This is the moment constituent power was made for. This is the time to stand up.

It’s imperative to keep up the pressure on Senators Feinstein and Harris. Here's how:

1. Ask both senators to continue to resist by withholding consent on senate business. **[Tell them to object! ](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/withholding-consent-filibuster-amendment-call-script/)**

2. Also ask both senators to try to bury TrumpCare in amendments. There's still time to submit a personal amendment if you haven't already. **It just takes a minute: [OurAmendments.org](https://www.ouramendments.org/)**

With a senate vote anticipated in 4 days, and the very real possibility of TrumpCare becoming law in less than a week, the only thing standing in Republicans' way is WE THE PEOPLE.
