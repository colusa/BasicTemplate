**Special guest: Chloe Stryker, the Indivisible Project's West Coast organizer.** 

Chloe will update us on national priorities for the Indivisible movement and what's happening with Indivisible groups across California. If you're new to the Indivisible movement, this will be a great opportunity to find out what it's about. And if you're an Indivisible regular, come ready to share your thoughts about how the national Indivisible team can effectively support activists working in rural northern California. 

**ABOUT INDIVISIBLE COLUSA'S MEETINGS**
Come to our open meetings to learn about the Indivisible movement. We focus on local, defensive, Congressional advocacy by making sure our Members of Congress in the Senate and House listen to us.

We're a small, friendly group of progressive-leaning Colusa County residents who work together to organize local political actions and events, participate in meetings with elected representatives, coordinate phone calls, and more.

We meet monthly on the first Monday of the month (unless it's a holiday). Our meetings are always free and open to the public.

Please note that our meeting place is on the second floor and there is no elevator. If that's a problem for you, please email us at indivisiblecolusa@gmail.com and we will try to find an accessible meeting place.
