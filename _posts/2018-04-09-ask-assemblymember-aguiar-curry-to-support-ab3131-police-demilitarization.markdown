If you live in State Assembly District 4, please call Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry's office before April 18 to urge her to support Assembly Bill 3131. 

Assembly District 4 includes Arbuckle and Williams. We're asking you to call Ms. Aguiar-Curry because she leads the Assembly's Local Government Committee, which will be hearing this bill on April 18. 

[You can learn more about AB3131 here. ](https://www.aclunc.org/our-work/legislation/police-militarization-ab-3131)

And here's a simple call script: 

Hi, my name is <YOUR NAME> and I am from <YOUR TOWN>. 

I am calling to ask Assemblymember Aguiar-Curry to support AB3131. This bill would require law enforcement to get permission and hold open hearings anytime they wanted to acquire military equipment. 

Thank you.
