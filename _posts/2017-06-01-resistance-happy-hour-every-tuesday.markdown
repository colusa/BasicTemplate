**Hosted by Indivisible Yolo 6-7 PM every Thursday in Davis.**

Meet up with Indivisible Yolo members at Three Mile Brewing for conversation, dogs, and good beer. They can register you to vote, help you get on amplify, or set you up with a postcard to write your representative! 

Don't need any of that? Come on by anyway, to let off some steam, prep for the weekend, and build camaraderie, because you're not alone, and together we will resist, persist, and make change!
