**SEPTEMBER COFFEE IN WILLIAMS IS CANCELLED. We'll be out knocking on voters' doors instead.**

THE RESISTANCE WILL BE CAFFEINATED! Come on out for coffee, camaraderie and conversation with Indivisible Colusa members. There’s no set agenda - we can share what’s been going on in the Indivisible movement locally and nationally, brainstorm ideas for future actions, or just enjoy some conversation with other progressive-leaning locals.

Newcomers welcome, and feel free to bring friends and family.
