Urge Sen. Harris to withhold consent on Senate business until a truly independent prosecutor is appointed to investigate connections between Trump associates and Russia. Call her SF office first, but try the other offices if you can’t get through. If you keep calling and can’t get a live person, then leave a voicemail.

Be sure to give your zip code and mention that you are a member of Indivisible Colusa. Members of Congress are specifically tracking communications from Indivisible groups. Let’s show them that we are a real force in resisting the Trump agenda!

CALL SCRIPT

My name is __________. I'm a constituent of Senator Harris. My zip code is  _______ , and I'm also a member of Indivisible Colusa, in Colusa County.

I'm calling to urge Senator Harris to withhold consent on any business in the Senate, until a truly independent prosecutor is appointed to investigate potential connections between Trump and his campaign and associates and Russian interference in our presidential election. 

The President has fired the very person who was overseeing an investigation into these links. We simply cannot go on with business as usual and let this issue go unaddressed or be put on the back burner by the GOP.  

We must have an independent investigation to get to the bottom of these issues and restore confidence in our democracy.
