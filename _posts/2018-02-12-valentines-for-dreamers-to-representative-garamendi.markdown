WHAT: Deliver a valentine to Representative Garamendi in support of Dreamers and a clean Dream Act

WHY: We are heartbroken over Rep. Garamendi's recent votes in support of the continuing resolutions on the budget that left Dreamers out and greatly decreased our chances of getting a clean Dream Act passed before the March 5th expiration of the DACA program. We want him to know how much constituent support he will have if he takes a strong stand for Dreamers.
