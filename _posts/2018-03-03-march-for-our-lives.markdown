It's time to follow the lead of America's youth and take to the streets to demand more effective gun safety measures. **Indivisible Colusa will be joining the March for Our Lives Chico on Saturday, 3/24. Our group is meeting at the Our Hands sculpture at 4th and Wall Streets at 10:45 AM.** Bring your family and friends and take a stand against gun violence.
