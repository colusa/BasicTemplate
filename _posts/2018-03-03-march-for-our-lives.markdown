It's time to follow the lead of America's youth and take to the streets to demand more effective gun safety measures. Indivisible Colusa will be joining the March for Our Lives Chico on Saturday, 3/24. Our group is meeting at the Our Hands sculpture at 4th and Wall Streets at 10:45 AM. Bring your family and friends and take a stand against gun violence. 

Want to carpool with us from Colusa County to Chico? [Send us an email](mailto:indivisiblecolusa@gmail.com)!

On March 24, the kids and families of March For Our Lives will take to the streets to demand that their lives and safety become a priority, and that we end gun violence in our schools and communities.
