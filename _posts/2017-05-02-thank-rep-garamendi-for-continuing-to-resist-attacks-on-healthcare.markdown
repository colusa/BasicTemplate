Trump just won’t let his awful healthcare bill die. This week, he renewed his demand that Congress pass an ACA repeal bill. But as the White House and congressional Republicans continue working on their bill, they’ve [only managed to make it worse](http://theweek.com/articles/693711/new-trumpcare-even-worse-than-old). What hasn’t changed is the devastation the bill will cause: at least 24 million Americans would lose their coverage, premiums would increase, and people with pre-existing conditions could face astronomical premiums.

Although Congressman Garamendi has been a vocal defender against these attacks on the ACA, it’s critical that he continue to hear that he has your support. Call today to thank him, and if possible, please share a a personal story about why TrumpCare would be a disaster for you or your family.
