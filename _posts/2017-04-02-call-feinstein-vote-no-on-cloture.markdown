Call Senator Feinstein to oppose Gorsuch’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. 

The important vote for Gorsuch is the “cloture” vote. Voting for “cloture” means voting to cut off debate and end a filibuster. This vote requires 60 votes to succeed, which means Senate Republicans CAN’T win this on their own — they don’t have enough votes. 

Senator Harris has already stated her opposition to Gorsuch. 

Sen. Feinstein remains undecided. Call now and ask her to vote “NO on cloture” for Gorsuch.
