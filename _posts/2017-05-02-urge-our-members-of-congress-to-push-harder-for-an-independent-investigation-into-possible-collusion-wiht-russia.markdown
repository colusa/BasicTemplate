  \
  Trump firing FBI Director James Comey has triggered an unprecedented crisis for our country. The President has fired the very person who was overseeing an investigation into links between his campaign and administration - perhaps even himself - and a foreign power that interfered in our presidential elections.
  \

  \
  The reasons given for the dismissal are clearly bogus and pretextual. Now more than ever we need to have an independent investigation into these activities to get to the bottom of them and restore basic confidence in the Republic.

  This unprecedented crisis requires an unprecedented response. We simply cannot go on with business as usual and let this issue go unaddressed or be put on the back burner by the GOP.  I call on Senator Harris to withhold consent on any business in the Senate, until an independent prosecutor is appointed with the remit and resources necessary to see that justice is done.

Call Senator Harris's SF office first, but try the other offices if you can’t get through. If you keep calling and can’t get to a live person, then leave a voicemail. 

If you choose to send an email or letter instead of calling, it’s essential that you write it in your own words. Copy-pasted emails are discounted by Congressional staff. We have to show that these issues mean so much to us that we’re putting in serious effort.

Don’t forget to mention that you are a member of Indivisible Colusa when you call. Members of Congress are specifically tracking communications from our Indivisible groups. Let’s show them that we are a real force in resisting the Trump agenda!
