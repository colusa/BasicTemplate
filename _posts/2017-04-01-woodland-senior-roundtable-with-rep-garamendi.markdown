Congressman Garamendi is hosting a series of senior conversations throughout the 3rd District focused on the concerns of local seniors. On April 20th, Congressman Garamendi will be at the Woodland Community and Senior on 2001 East St. from 10:30 am-12:00 pm. 

Case workers will be standing by to help constituents with their Social Security, Medicare, and VA claims.
