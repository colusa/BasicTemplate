Join us as we celebrate recent Indivisible successes (there will be cake and bubbly!) and talk about how we can keep making a difference during the August Congressional recess. 

In the second part of our meeting, Eric Paredes and Bryce Miller-Williams will lead us in a fun, interactive training on how to hold organizer conversations. Eric and Bryce are political organizers with SEIU Local 2015, which has about 150 members working in the service industry in Colusa County. Organizer conversations are an effective way to connect with people about what matters most to them, and then move them toward action - like calling their Members of Congress or joining the Indivisible movement. 

**ABOUT OUR MEETINGS**

Come to Indivisible Colusa's open meetings to learn about the Indivisible movement and to meet progressive-leaning people who want the best for this country and are willing to work for it. We focus on local, defensive, Congressional advocacy by holding our Members of Congress in the Senate and House accountable for listening to us and being our voice in Washington.

We're a small, friendly group of Colusa County residents who work together to organize local political actions and events, participate in meetings with elected representatives, coordinate phone calls, and more.

**Please note:**
Our meeting place is on the second floor and there is no elevator. If that's a problem for you, please email us at [indivisiblecolusa@gmail.com](mailto:indivisiblecolusa@gmail.com) and we will try to find an accessible meeting place.

Indivisible Colusa's meetings are always free and open to the public. Newcomers are very welcome. Come check us out!

RSVP NOT NECESSARY.
