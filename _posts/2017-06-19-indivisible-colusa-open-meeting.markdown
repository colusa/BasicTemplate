We meet monthly on the first Monday of the month (due to the July 4 holiday, our July meeting will be on Monday July 10). 

Come to our open meetings to learn about the Indivisible movement. We focus on local, defensive, Congressional advocacy by holding our Members of Congress in the Senate and House accountable for listening to us and being our voice in Washington. 

We're a small, friendly group of Colusa County residents who work together to organize local political actions and events, participate in meetings with elected representatives, coordinate phone calls, and more.
