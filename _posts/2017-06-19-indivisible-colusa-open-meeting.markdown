In our August meeting, we'll celebrate recent Indivisible successes and make plans for new actions to resist Trump's efforts to roll back civil rights, our social safety net and environmental protections. 

Also, we'll be joined by Eric Paredes from SEIU Local 2015, which has about 150 members working in the service industry in Colusa County. Eric will share his experiences as a local political organizer, and will give us tips on how to effectively communicate our views and values. 

**ABOUT OUR MEETINGS**

Come to Indivisible Colusa's open meetings to learn about the Indivisible movement and to meet progressive-leaning people who want the best for this country and are willing to work for it. We focus on local, defensive, Congressional advocacy by holding our Members of Congress in the Senate and House accountable for listening to us and being our voice in Washington.

We're a small, friendly group of Colusa County residents who work together to organize local political actions and events, participate in meetings with elected representatives, coordinate phone calls, and more.

**Please note:**
Our meeting place is on the second floor and there is no elevator. If that's a problem for you, please email us at [indivisiblecolusa@gmail.com](mailto:indivisiblecolusa@gmail.com) and we will try to find an accessible meeting place.

Indivisible Colusa's meetings are always free and open to the public. Newcomers are very welcome. Come check us out!
