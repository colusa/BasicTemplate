Join Indivisible co-founders Ezra Levin and Leah Greenberg at 6 p.m. PT tonight for a Reclaim Recess Facebook Live event. You can submit questions about the District Work Period, Congress, and the Tax March in advance to [questions@indivisibleguide.com](mailto:questions@indivisibleguide.com). Be sure to register. 

Not on Facebook? No problem! We’ll be sending a streaming link to everyone who RSVPs, just in case you would rather watch the stream on our site. 

That link will also contain dial-in information for attendees who want to listen in via phone. 

Miss last week’s event?
