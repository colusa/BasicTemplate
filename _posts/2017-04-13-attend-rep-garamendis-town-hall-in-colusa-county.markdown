Please join U.S. Congressman John Garamendi for a town hall conversation about critical issues facing the 3rd District and our country. 

And please share this event widely with District 3 constituents. It's a great opportunity to hear directly from our Congressman about what's going on in Washington DC.

This event is free and open to the public. 

Indivisible Colusa is proud to join Indivisible Yuba-Sutter, Indivisible Yolo, Democracy Winters, Indivisible Fairfield and Indivisible Vacaville in co-sponsoring this town hall.
