**Get motivated and get trained to flip the U.S. BLUE on election day!** The afternoon includes: 

**Keynote speech by Shabbir Safdar:** Shabbir is the founder of the Cal Away canvassing team. He'll tell us how you can make a difference in November's critical election.

**Breakouts sessions:** Learn about textbanking, phonebanking, postcarding, door-to-door canvassing, voter registration and fundraising. Get trained so you can make more of a difference and find out where you can put these skills to use.
