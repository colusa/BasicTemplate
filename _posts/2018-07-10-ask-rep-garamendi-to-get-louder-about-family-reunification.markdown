call-script-text: "Hi! My name is ____ and I'm calling from (city or zip code). I'm
  also a member of Indivisible Colusa County.\n\nI'm calling to ask Congressman Garamendi
  to be more aggressive in his efforts on behalf of families separated at the border.
  \n\nWhether it's because of malice or incompetence or both, the Trump administration
  has failed to meet the court's deadline for family reunification. Every day that
  goes by inflicts more trauma on these children and their parents. \n\nPlease ask
  the Congressman to put greater public pressure on the Trump administration to fix
  this human rights disaster that they created.  \n\nThank you. "

The Trump administration created a human rights disaster with it's "zero tolerance" policy. Now it's failing to meet court-imposed deadlines for reunifying migrant children and their parents.
