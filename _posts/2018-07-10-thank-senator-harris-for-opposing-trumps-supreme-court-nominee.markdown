  I'm also a member of Indivisible Colusa County. \n\nI’m very glad to hear that Senator
  Harris plans to vote against the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for Supreme Court
  Justice. \n\nToo much is at stake to let Trump fill this seat with an extremist
  judge who will jeopardize women's right to choose, the Affordable Care Act, marriage
  equality, and other fundamental rights. \n\nPlease ask Senator Harris to use every
  tool at her disposal to block this nomination.\n\nThank you."

Trump's Supreme Court Justice nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, is an extremist idealogue who represents a direct and fundamental threat to the rights and health care of hundreds of millions of Americans.
