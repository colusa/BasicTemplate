Come to our open meeting to learn about the Indivisible movement. We focus on local, defensive, Congressional advocacy by encouraging our Members of Congress in the Senate and House to represent us, not Trump.

We're a small, friendly group of Colusa County residents who work together to organize local political actions and events, participate in meetings with elected representatives, coordinate phone calls, and more. 

Check out our [Successes](http://indivisiblecolusa.com/successes.html) page to find out what we've been up to lately.
