Indivisible Colusa members are going to the Tax March Sacramento to demand that Donald Trump come clean about his business dealings, financial ties and conflicts of interest. 

If you live in Colusa County, let's carpool and march together! Some of us will be driving from Arbuckle. We may also have members going from Williams and Colusa. [Send us an email](mailto:indivisiblecolusa@gmail.com) if you're interested in carpooling and we'll work out the details. 

Don't forget a sign!
