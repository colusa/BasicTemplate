Here's how we can have our biggest impact on what's going on in Washington: showing up at our elected officials' local offices and events. We've got two great opportunities this week: 

Tuesday, 7/18, Sacramento - #KILLTHEBILL Be part of a national Indivisible Day of Action to kill the Republican's "health care" bill once and for all. Join Indivisible Colusa and other local resistance groups at Sen. Kamala Harris' office in Sacramento between 10AM and 5PM. 

Friday, 7/21, Davis - Town Hall with Congressman John Garamendi. Get an update from our congressman on what's going on in D.C. Share your concerns and have your voice heard.
