Organized by Indivisible CA-04. 

Join local resistance and peace groups in this CELEBRATION of diversity, acceptance and inclusion, as we gather to show the world that we will not accept any form of hate in our district. 

WHY: A group called ACT FOR AMERICA has chosen Roseville as one only 22 different locations across the country to stage a special demonstration. The group has been classified as a HATE GROUP, and has made it their mission to villainize Muslims, building a plaform to perpetuate and promote the most hateful language imaginable. 

They may believe they've chosen a safe location with Roseville (as opposed to say, San Francisco), but they have no idea about Indivisible CA-04, and how we've grown over the past three months.

WE WILL NOT ACCEPT HATE IN OUR COMMUNITY!!

WHAT: We are calling 1,500 Indivisibles from across CA-04 and Northern California to come together for peacful Unity Rally. We will show our support for people of every race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, color, ethnicity, and ability.
