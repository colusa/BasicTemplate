CONFIRMED: We have a new date, time & place for our May meeting: Tuesday, May 9, 6:30-8:00 pm. We're so sorry our date change has inconvenienced you, and we do hope you can make it. We're thrilled that the owners of the Masonic Lodge in Williams have generously offered us meeting space. Everyone is welcome!

Come to our open meeting to learn about the Indivisible movement, and join with other Colusa County residents to plan Congressional office visits, coordinate phone calls, and more. We focus on encouraging our Members of Congress in the Senate and House to represent us, not Trump.

If we stand together, indivisible, we will win. Welcome to the resistance!
