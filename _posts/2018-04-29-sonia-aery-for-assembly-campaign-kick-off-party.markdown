We're gathering at the Tap Room in downtown Colusa to kick off Democrat Sonia Aery's campaign efforts in Colusa & Glenn Counties!

All are welcome to this family friendly event. Meet your progressive candidate for the California Assembly and learn more about her plans for the future of the 3rd District.
