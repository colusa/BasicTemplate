An attack on one is an attack on all. Together, we must speak out and stand up for immigrants in our communities. 

Donald Trump took another step in enacting his white supremacist agenda by announcing the rescission of the [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqzBfZ7oSZA), effectively turning 800,000 American lives into fodder for his for-profit [deportation machine](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/defund-trumps-mass-deportation-machine/). 

There are 237,940 DACA recipients in California alone, and each year they contribute [$534,124,000](https://itep.org/wp-content/uploads/2017DACA.pdf) in State and local taxes. Donald Trump has betrayed our values and unraveled our promise to these young immigrants who grew up calling the United States home. Now it’s up to our representatives in Congress to stand up to Trump’s hateful decision and secure the futures of DACA recipients with a legislative fix: The DREAM Act (S.1615 / H.R.3440).

Call Congressman Garamendi and Senators Feinstein and Harris today and demand that they commit to supporting a clean, stand-alone DREAM Act (S.1615 / H.R.3440). Any bill that uses immigrant young people as bargaining chips - by protecting immigrant youth from deportation in exchange for putting more deportation agents on the streets to round up their parents, friends, family members, and to terrorize immigrant communities or by holding this program ransom in return for funding the wasteful border wall - is a non-starter and Congress must reject those bills.
