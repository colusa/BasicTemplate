Join us for camaraderie for a cause! **We're writing postcards to urge voters to get out and vote for Democrat CONOR LAMB for U.S. Congress.** In 2016, Trump won Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional district by a large margin. There's a special election on March 13 to replace the Republican Congressman who resigned in disgrace. Let's help CONOR LAMB turn the 18th District blue! 

Ed is buying the appetizers and stamps. Jen is bringing the postcards, pens, voter addresses and writing scripts. **All you need to do is help us write a bunch of postcards.** Buy your own drinks and dinner if you wish.
