Our general monthly meeting is the first Monday night of the month. This fall, our monthly meetings are focused on tangible actions to Get Out the Vote. 

**Join us on October 1 to write postcards to local voters. **

We provide all the materials: postcards, addresses, scripts, pens, and stamps (although using your own stamps helps us stretch our budget to reach more voters). 

Newcomers always welcome. Writing postcards to voters is a fun, low-key way to make a difference. 

RSVPs appreciated but not required. [Click here to RSVP.](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/60b0e4fafac2cabf49-getout)
