call-script-text: "My name is ______ and I am calling from zip code _______. \n\nI'm
  very disappointed in Congressman Garamendi for not standing with minority leader
  Pelosi and the majority of Democrats in their fight for the Dreamers. The Democrats
  made a promise to fight for a clean Dream Act. But when they don't stand strong
  as a group, it's no surprise that they fail. \n\nMajority leader Paul Ryan won't
  put a clean Dream Act up for a vote unless he is forced to do so. Can I trust Congressman
  Garamendi to stand with the rest of the Democrats to make sure this happens next
  time the Continuing Resolution runs out?\n"
