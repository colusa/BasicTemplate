At our Arbuckle coffee meet up on Thursday, April 19, we'll be joined by Joe Lauwerijssen. Joe is a candidate for Colusa County Supervisor for District 1 (Arbuckle, College City). The election is on June 5. 

Everyoneâ€™s welcome to stop in, have a cup of coffee, and chat with Joe.

We met with the other candidate, Merced Corona, on April 5.


**Join Indivisible Colusa County members for a weekly coffee meetup in Arbuckle.** We write postcards to get out the vote for progressive candidates, offer help, resources and connections for our activism activities, and share ideas for promoting a healthier democracy.

Can't make Thursday mornings? We also have a coffee meetup on the third Saturday of the month at Caffeinated in Colusa. And we have our regular open meetings with guest speakers on the first Monday night of the month in Williams.

Indivisible Colusa County is a grassroots group of neighbors who embrace the American principles of compassion, decency, diversity, tolerance, equality and democracy. If this describes you, please join us!
