  **SAMPLE CALL SCRIPT**

  **Caller:** Hello! My name is [___] and I’m calling from [part of state]. I’m calling to let [Senator __] know that I strongly oppose the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This tax bill is a scam that will give massive cuts to the wealthy, paid for by stripping 1.8 million Californians of their health care and raising taxes on nearly 4 million middle-class families.

  **Staffer:** Thank you for calling! The Senator is against the Republican tax bill; she does not believe we should give a tax cut to the wealthy and corporations or strip people of their health insurance coverage.

  **Caller:** That’s great. Will the Senator commit to withholding consent on votes in the Senate so that we have time to mobilize against this bill?

  **Staffer:** I haven’t talked to the Senator about that, but I’ll pass your thoughts along.

  **Caller:** That’s what I expect out of the Senator. It’s not enough just to vote no, she needs to actively work to slow down the Trump Tax Scam and expose it for the scam it is. Democrats started withholding consent during the health care fight — and it worked. That’s what I want to see again here. Please take down my info so you can let me know what she is doing to slow down the Trump Tax Scam.

  **Staffer:** I’ll pass your thoughts along to the Senator.

  **Caller:** Yes please do, and please take down my contact information so you can let me know what the Senator decides to do.
