**For our August 6 general meeting, we're throwing a Pizza & Postcard Party! We'll be writing postcards to encourage registered Democrats in Colusa County to vote on Nov. 6.**

Friendly, handwritten postcards from volunteers is a great way to motivate voters who might normally sit out a midterm election.

**Indivisible Colusa will provide pizza, soft drinks, postcards, stamps, pens and even the script. No experience necessary. Newcomers welcome!**

We'll also be sharing our plans for more Get Out the Vote activities between now and Election Day, including more postcarding events and door-to-door canvassing in Colusa County and beyond.

## About Indivisible Colusa
**Our vision:** Liberty and justice for all. 

**Who we are:** Weâ€™re an independent group informally affiliated with a national network of thousands of Indivisible groups that formed in the wake of the 2016 presidential election. 

We meet monthly on the first Monday of the month. Our meetings are free and open to the public. There are no membership dues and no membership obligations other than to treat each other with kindness and respect.

**What we do**: We put pressure on our elected representatives to support progressive policies such as health care for all, sensible and compassionate immigration reform, and economic policies that address income inequality.  

Please join us!
