**Our vision:** Liberty and justice for all. 

**Who we are:** Weâ€™re an independent group informally affiliated with a national network of thousands of Indivisible groups that formed in the wake of the 2016 presidential election. 

We meet monthly on the first Monday of the month. Our meetings are free and open to the public. There are no membership dues and no membership obligations other than to treat each other with kindness and respect.

**What we do**: We put pressure on our elected representatives to support progressive policies such as health care for all, sensible and compassionate immigration reform, and economic policies that address income inequality.  

Please join us!
