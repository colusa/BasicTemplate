Rumors are swirling that Donald Trump is preparing to take action to impede or end Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the extent to which Donald Trump and his associates were involved. 

If that happens, thousands of peaceful protests will be taking place throughout the country - including here in Colusa County. Let's pray that these protests won't be necessary, but let's be prepared to speak up and stand together to protect our democracy.
