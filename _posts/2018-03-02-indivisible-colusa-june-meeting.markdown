Indivisible Colusaâ€™s monthly meetings are always free and open to the public. Typically we spend about half the meeting in an informal conversation with a local community leader, and the other half discussing recent accomplishments, upcoming activities and developments in the Indivisible movement. 

The guest speaker for our June meeting will be announced shortly. 

Indivisible Colusa County is a nonpartisan grassroots group of neighbors who embrace the American values of compassion, decency, diversity, tolerance, equality and democracy.
