We need all hands on deck, folks! The next five months will be critical for growing the blue wave in California and nationwide. Come learn about the Indivisible movement, meet other progressive-leaning locals, and find out how you can get involved. 

Indivisible Colusaâ€™s monthly meetings are always free and open to the public. Indivisible Colusa County is a nonpartisan grassroots group of neighbors who embrace the American values of compassion, decency, diversity, tolerance, equality and democracy.
