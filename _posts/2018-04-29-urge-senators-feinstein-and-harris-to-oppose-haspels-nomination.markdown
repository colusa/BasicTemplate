[Here's an explainer from Indivisible about Gina Haspel and her history of torture.](http://haspel.indivisible.org) 

Opposition to Haspel's nomination cuts across party lines. [In this open letter](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/RMLSenateLetterOnHaspelNomination.pdf) to the Senate, scores of retired military officials make the case for why Haspel is unfit to lead the CIA: 

"We devoted our lives to the defense of our country. We know that fidelity to our most cherished ideals as a nation is the foundation of our security. **The torture and cruel treatment of prisoners undermines our national security by increasing the risks to our troops, hindering cooperation with allies, alienating populations whose support the United States needs in the struggle against terrorism, and providing a propaganda tool for extremists who wish to do us harm.** It would send a
terrible signal to confirm as the next Director of the CIA someone who was so intimately involved in this dark chapter of our nationâ€™s history."
