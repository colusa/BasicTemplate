Face-to-face conversations are THE most effective way to Get Out the Vote. Come learn how to be part of our GOTV Colusa County canvassing campaign to boost Democratic voter turnout this November. 

**What to expect: Free pizza, prizes and a fun (and short) training in door-to-door canvassing using Indivisible's Get Out the Vote smartphone app.**

Our actual canvassing events will start in mid-September. **The September 10th event is a training session only (+pizza!).**

Never canvassed before? No worries! We'll show you how fun and easy it is and answer all your questions. No smartphone? No problem! When it comes time to start knocking on doors, we'll team you up with folks who have access to the canvassing app.

Our democracy works better when caring people like you show up and pitch in.
