Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was arrested on October 30 and indicted on several charges, including conspiracy against the United States.

**Let that sink in: the person who managed Trump’s presidential campaign has now been charged with conspiracy against the United States.** Manafort’s associate Rick Gates has also been indicted, and Trump campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos has pled guilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with Russia.

This development is the latest evidence that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation continues to get closer to the truth. That means he is even more at risk of being fired by Donald Trump.

The attacks on our democracy under Donald Trump should worry you no matter what your political party. Donald Trump has repeatedly acted as if the rules—and the law—don’t apply to him. That’s why Indivisible has been calling for [impeachment hearings](http://www.indivisible.org/resource/truth-or-trump/) for violations already committed, including obstruction of justice—Trump fired James Comey, the man charged with investigating his political campaign’s links to Russia.

The Senate Intelligence Committee made clear on October 4 that they will not be investigating Trump’s obstruction of justice attempts - they’re looking to Mueller. It is now more crucial than ever to protect Mueller and his investigation.

**WHO IS ROBERT MUELLER AND WHY DOES HE MATTER?**

Robert Mueller is the special counsel appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to investigate Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. He was appointed after then FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into Russian interference, was fired by Donald Trump. After immense public pressure to insulate the investigation from political interference, Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller to lead an independent investigation. Mueller is a Republican, respected by both sides of the aisle, who previously served as FBI director under President George W. Bush and also President Obama.

**FIRING COMEY CREATED A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS. FIRING MUELLER WOULD BE A CRISIS TIMES TEN.**

Firing Comey was obstruction of justice, pure and simple. But firing Mueller would be far worse—because the entire reason Mueller has this job is to protect the investigation from political interference. No one is above the law, especially not the President of the United States. When President Nixon in the [Saturday Night Massacre](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/can-learn-nixons-saturday-night-massacre) demanded the firing of Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor looking into Watergate, Congress and the American people recognized that for what it was—a turning point and a crisis that would later spell the end of the Nixon presidency. Since Mueller is leading the investigation in place of someone else who was already inappropriately fired, his firing would be especially concerning.

**WHAT CAN WE DO?**

All Americans need to be clear that we will not stand for this. Indivisible is teaming up with a coalition of groups to host emergency rallies in the event that Mueller is fired. We hope that this terrible event will not come to pass—but if it does, we will all need to stand firm and make it clear that no one is above the law. 

In the event that Trump fires Mueller, Indivisible Colusa will hold an emergency rally that day or the following day at the Veteran's Memorial Park in Colusa, at the corner of 10th and Market Streets. Bring signs, extra sign making materials, noisemakers, flameless candles - or just drop everything and come as you are. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter for date and time announcements. But let's hope it doesn't come to this.
