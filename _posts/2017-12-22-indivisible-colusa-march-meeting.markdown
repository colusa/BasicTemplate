Our monthly meetings include informal conversations with local leaders. This is a great opportunity to share values and priorities and find common ground. 

In March, we're pleased to welcome [Sonia Aery]![SoniaAery.png](/uploads/SoniaAery.png)(http://www.soniaforassembly.com/), who was recently endorsed by the California Democratic Party as a candidate for State Assembly District 3 in the June 5 primary. 

Our meetings are always free and open to the public. Please join us.

Please note that our meeting place is on the second floor and there is no elevator. We're working on finding a centrally located, accessible meeting place.
