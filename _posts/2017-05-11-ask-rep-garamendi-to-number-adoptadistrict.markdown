Every American deserves to be heard and get answers to their questions, especially when it comes to matters of life and death. Members of Congress who want to ensure that people are prioritized over politics and stop the House AHCA bill in its tracks should step up and #AdoptADistrict.  

Adopting a district is similar to hosting an empty chair town hall, except the person in the chair may be a neighboring or near-by member of Congress who is stepping in to help their peersâ€™ constituents who are being ignored.

**Congressman Garamendi has agreed to #AdoptADistrict but hasn't said where or when. He and his staff need to know they have our support before they will actually do this. **

Here's a call script below. And go to [indivisibleguide.com](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/adopt-district-guide/) if you want to learn more about #AdoptADistrict. 

CALL SCRIPT

Hi, my name is ____ and I'm one of Congressman Garamendi's constituents from ___ (city), ___ (zip code). I'm also a member of Indivisible Colusa.

I'm calling because Congressman Garamendi has been such a great defender of healthcare. I would like him to adopt Congressman McClintock's district this recess to explain to his constituents how bad the AHCA is, since McClintock refuses to hold a town hall and defend his vote for the AHCA.

The adopt-a-district tactic is taking off across the country. Representative Maloney and Representative Gallego have adopted neighboring GOP districts whose representatives are missing in action. I'd love to see Rep. Garamendi do the same and continue to be the strong advocate for healthcare that he has been. 

Thank you!
