Science protects the health of our communities, the safety of our families, the education of our children, the foundation of our economy and jobs, and the future we all want to live in and preserve for coming generations. 

We speak up now - and on April 22 we march in communities all around the world - because all of these values are currently at risk.

**â€‹When science is threatened, so is the society that scientists uphold and protect. Join the March for Science on Earth Day, April 22.**
