Indivisible Colusa members are going to the March for Science - Sacramento on Earth Day (April 22). The March for Science will be a massive public celebration of science and the enormous public service it provides in our democracy, our economy, and in all our daily lives.

If you live in Colusa County, let's carpool and march for science together! Some of us will be driving from Arbuckle. We may also have members going from Williams and Colusa. [Send us an email ](mailto:indivisiblecolusa@gmail.com)if you're interested in carpooling and we'll work out the details. 

Don't forget a sign!
