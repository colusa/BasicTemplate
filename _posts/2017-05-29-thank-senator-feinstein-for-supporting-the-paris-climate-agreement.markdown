Last week, 40 Senate Democrats including Sen. Feinstein sent a letter to the President arguing that backing out of the agreement could put American health and safety at risk and hurt our economy. 

[Read the letter](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=8327CDF1-E856-449C-88C6-35FEB0DA581E) and then give Sen. Feinstein a callÂ to ask her to keep voicing strong support for the Paris Climate Agreement.
