  of Indivisible Colusa. \n\nI’m calling to let Congressman Garamendi know that I’m
  grateful for his advocacy on behalf of immigrant families that have been separated
  at the border.\n\nPlease thank him for taking the trip to investigate the detention
  facilities at the border. I hope that as he continues to fight for the most vulnerable
  in this country, he also takes care of himself. \n\nHe has witnessed first-hand
  some of the tragedies taking place at the border detention centers. Vicarious trauma
  can have similar effects as direct trauma. I'd like to encourage the Congressman
  to take care of himself and engage in self-care practices that feed his soul.  \n\nThank
  you. "

Elected officials mostly hear from constituents who are mad at them. Make sure you tell them when they're doing a good job. And consider acknowledging the personal toll their work can sometimes take.
