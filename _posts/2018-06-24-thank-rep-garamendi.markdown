call-script-text: "My name is ______ and I live in (town/zip code). I'm also a member
  of Indivisible Colusa. \n\nI'm calling to let Congressman Garamendi know that I'm
  grateful for his advocacy on behalf of immigrant families that have been separated
  because of President Trump's inhumane \"zero tolerance\" policy. \n\nPlease thank
  him for taking the trip to investigate the detention facilities at the border. It
  would also be great if he would investigate what's going on in immigration detention
  centers in the 3rd District. \n\nDo you know if any of the separated children are
  being held in our District? And if so, what does the Congressman know about plans
  to \nsafely and swiftly reunite them with their families?\n\nThank you. "

Elected officials mostly hear from constituents that are mad at them. Make sure you tell them when they're doing a good job.
