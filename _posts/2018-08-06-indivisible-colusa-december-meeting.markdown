Come to our open meetings to learn about the Indivisible movement. There are more than 5,000 Indivisible groups across the country that formed in the wake of the 2016 election. Indivisible Colusa's actions are mostly focused on holding our elected representatives accountable for listening to us and representing us locally, in Sacramento and in Washington, D.C. 

Our volunteers are residents of Colusa County and neighboring areas who work together to organize local political actions and events, participate in meetings with elected representatives, coordinate phone calls, and more.

We meet monthly on the first Monday of the month. Our meetings are always free and open to the public.
