call-script-text: "I'm calling from [zip code] to ask Congressman Garamendi to do
  everything in his power to stop the FCC from killing net neutrality. \n\nEnsuring
  equal access to the internet is vital to our democracy.  \n\nNet neutrality is particularly
  important to residents of small towns and rural communities like Colusa County,
  where the internet is often a lifeline to crucial services, opportunities and information.
  \n\nPlease tell the Congressman that I'm expecting him to fight for net neutrality. "
