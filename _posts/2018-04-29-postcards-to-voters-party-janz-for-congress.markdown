We're getting together to write postcards asking voters in the Fresno area to support Andrew Janz for Congress in the June 5 primary election. Janz is running in California Congressional District 22 against incumbent Devin Nunes. 

We'll supply postcards, scripts, pens and markers and stamps. Join us! Writing postcards to voters is a fun and easy way to get out the VOTE.
