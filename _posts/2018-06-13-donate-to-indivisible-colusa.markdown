As we head into the midterms, the national Indivisible project wants to make sure all the local Indivisible groups have the necessary resources to continue building the blue wave. 

[**Right now, every dollar Indivisible Colusa receives through our ActBlue donation account will be matched one-for-one, up to $500!**](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/indivisiblecol413728470#)


Indivisible Colusa is completely volunteer run. This summer and fall, we're putting our energy into getting Democrats and progressives to vote in November - here in rural, conservative Colusa County and in neighboring districts where there's a real shot at flipping Congressional seats from red to blue.

We're asking for your help because so much is at stake. If we don't manage to take back Congress in November, we're sure to see an escalation of Trump's war on immigrants, civil rights, women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights, working people and the environment.

Over the next month, we need to raise $2,600 in individual donations from people like you to keep up our momentum.

Our immediate costs include:

* $500 for our Trump Survival Kits that we give out to break the ice when engaging voters
* $900 for door-to-door canvassing supplies, including flyers, pledge-to-vote cards, and plenty of snacks and cold soft drinks to fuel our volunteers as they hit the streets of Colusa County
* $1,200 for postcards, postage and other supplies to send Get Out the Vote postcards to Democratic voters 

We have a real opportunity this November to take back the reins of our government and stop Trump's and the GOP's hateful agenda. 

Contribute today to Indivisible Colusa. Together, we will win.
