  I'm also a member of Indivisible Colusa County \n\nI’m calling about Trump's nomination
  of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. \n\nI'm glad that Senator Feinstein is
  being vocal about how far outside the mainstream Kavanaugh's views are. His record
  shows that he will undermine women's right to choose, the Affordable Care Act, marriage
  equality and other hard-won rights. \n\nPlease ask Senator Feinstein to state publicly
  and unambigously that she will vote NO on his nomination. \n\nThank you. "
