The Trump Tax Scam is tax cuts for the wealthy paid for by the rest of us. We can take action to stop this bill by making calls to progressive voters in a key state with a swing Republican Senator. 

### This fight will come down to just a couple of Senators and the time to take action is now. 

Indivisible has brought back a super effective peer-to-peer calling tool from the TrumpCare fight so those of us in blue states can contact progressive constituents in Alaska, Arizona and West Virginia. 

**Itâ€™s super easy:** Using the Kill TrumpCare tool, 2,233 Indivisible volunteers across the country dialed 320,552 calls to encourage constituents in Alaska, Arizona, Maine and Colorado to call their Republican senators and tell them to vote no on Graham-Cassidy. And we won. We can win this time, too, with your help.
