We only have a few more days to stop the #TrumpTaxScam. The Senate is back in session on November 27 and they could pass this disgraceful bill within a few days. Your voice will be the difference in this fight. We need to make ***a ton of noise.*** 


### This fight will come down to just a couple of swing Republican Senators who haven't yet decided where they stand on the tax bill. The time for us to take action is now. 

Indivisible has brought back a super effective peer-to-peer calling tool from the TrumpCare fight so those of us in blue states can contact progressive constituents in Alaska, Arizona and West Virginia. 

**Itâ€™s super easy:** Using the Kill TrumpCare tool, 2,233 Indivisible volunteers across the country dialed 320,552 calls to encourage constituents in Alaska, Arizona, Maine and Colorado to call their Republican senators and tell them to vote no on Graham-Cassidy. And we won. We can win this time, too, with your help.
